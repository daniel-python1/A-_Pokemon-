# üöó A* Pathfinding Car Simulator

Welcome to the **A* Pathfinding Car Simulator** repository! This project showcases an advanced multi-car navigation system using the **A* pathfinding algorithm** within a dynamic city grid. It simulates cars finding their way through complex road networks, dealing with obstacles, traffic, and even handling deadlock situations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Car Navigation:** Simulates multiple cars finding paths simultaneously in dynamic environments.
- **Dynamic City Grid:** Randomly generated city layouts with different building patterns, parks, and swamps.
- **Deadlock Detection:** Intelligent handling of traffic deadlocks where cars wait for paths to clear.
- **Path Recalculation:** Cars dynamically recalculate their paths when blocked by obstacles.
- **Realistic Obstacles:** Includes buildings, blocks, and terrain that influence car movement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for simulation logic.
- **p5.js**: Library for creative coding and rendering visuals.
- **A Star Algorithm**: Optimized pathfinding algorithm for efficient navigation.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Modular code structure for cars, grid, and pathfinding logic.
